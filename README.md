Project Context:
Margarita is about to open her veterinary clinic for cats and dogs and asks us to create a patient management system. Margarita has asked us to create a rest API that stores data in an in-memory database (H2 Database) or dockerized MySQL, and can be consumed from that front end.

Project Description:
The objective of this project is to develop a patient management system in Java that allows Margarita to list, add, edit and delete patients. The application will also allow users to manage their appointments efficiently (make appointments, view a list of appointments, modify and cancel appointments), keeping an organized record of them.

Project Objectives:
1. Reinforce students' object-oriented programming concepts.
2. Apply encapsulation to hide the internal implementation of classes and protect data.
3. Develop a flowchart that explains the client management system.
4. Develop the code that represents the proposed diagram

. Functional Requirements of the Project:    
- List, add, modify and delete patients.
- Each patient must have a profile that includes:
- name
- age
- race
- gender
- ID number
- guardian's name and surname
- guardian's phone number
- A patient's data must be accessible from their ID number
- The API must provide the treatments performed on each patient
- List, add, modify and delete appointments.
- Each appointment will include:
   - Date and time
   - Patient
   - Standard / urgent consultation
   - Reason for appointment
   - Appointment status (pending, past)

Extras:
Add image to each patient's profile (Using Firebase Storage)
User registration 
DTOs
Dockerize
Technical requirements of the Project:
1. Knowledge of Java programming.
2. Knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
3. Good practices
4. Unit tests (Models, Services and controllers)

Evaluation methods:  Team project.

Expected deliverables:
1. A patient management system implemented in Java, using the Spring framework and its Spring Boot module, which meets the requirements mentioned above
2. Controllers, Services and models tested.
3. Test coverage: 70%
4. Repository on GitHub with the corresponding README
5. Screenshot of the testing coverage
6. Presentation where the entire development process followed can be observed

Project Schedule: - 3-week Sprint

Performance criteria:
The layers of the backend architecture must be well defined
Database tables must be normalized
Unit tests
